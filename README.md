## About *self*
***self*** stands for _Simple Exploratory Learning Framework_. Goal of this project is to provide a simple package with which a novice as well as an advanced R programmer, can quickly dissect and analyze a dataset. In addition, to providing wrappers with error tracing, this package can be customized and extended to maintain a code base for creating predictive models when exploring multiple types datasets, consectively. 

To summarize, ***self*** is good when analyzing lots data by yourself, but can also be extended by an organization to become a standard package for internal use.

## Style Guide
When writing this package, the following guidelines were followed as strictly as possible, [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#assignment) 

## Examples 
Checkout the web app [housing-predictions](https://github.com/admurali/housing-prediction) that uses ***self*** and Shiny, a web application framework using R, to allow users to predict a value of a house in Cupertino, California, where Apple's headquarter (HQ) is located.

## About Me
I am currently a R&D Scrum Master/Project Lead for Mass Spectrometry Software Development at Agilent Technologies in Santa Clara, CA. I graduated with a Bachelor and Master of Science in Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. I have published several publications in the realm of Engineering and Biology. 

I have deep interest in Data Science and its applications for Metabolomics, Genomics and Healthcare. In addition to my work and personal hobbies, I also teach developers and engineers in Silicon Valley Machine Learning using R. I enjoy teaching as it is a great way to meet myraid professionals from junior developers to senior directors in the valley and it is one of the best ways to learn.
